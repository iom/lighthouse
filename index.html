        <p>Mobility and migration across the Americas are shaped by a complex set of interrelated drivers. The region—particularly Central and South America—has long been characterized by high levels of violence, political and economic instability, and structural inequality. These dynamics, combined with recurring environmental shocks and shifting policy landscapes, contribute to diverse and overlapping migration patterns, including transit, circular, and irregular flows. Despite the scale and complexity of these movements, monitoring them remains a considerable challenge. Many countries lack timely, standardized, and comparable migration statistics, which limits the capacity of governments and humanitarian actors to respond effectively to emerging needs and trends (https://publications.iom.int/books/migration-data-strategy-2020-2025).</p>

        <p>To help close this gap, IOM's Lighthouse Programme supports efforts to improve the availability, comparability, and use of migration data across the Americas. One of its core workstreams focuses on consolidating and harmonizing administrative data already collected by governments—namely border entries and exits—into a unified regional dataset. While these data sources were not originally designed for migration trend analysis, when systematically compiled, they offer critical insights into the movements of people across the region. The consolidated administrative dataset developed under the Lighthouse Programme represents the first regional effort and dataset of its kind. It brings together temporally disaggregated data by nationality, enabling regional month-by-month analysis of cross-border mobility across a growing number of countries in the Americas. The data is sourced from official government websites and publicly accessible platforms, with some data shared directly with IOM under agreements that grant permission for their use in analysis and reporting.</p>
        
        <p>This is an ongoing and expanding initiative, with additional countries and data sources being integrated into the system on a rolling basis as part of IOM's broader commitment to improving migration data availability in the region.</p>
