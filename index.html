        <p>Human mobility across the Americas is driven by intersecting political, economic, environmental, and policy factors, resulting in complex patterns of migration and mobility. Despite a rich migration data landscape, data is often fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to compare across countries. To help address these gaps, IOM's Lighthouse Programme (Comprehensive Data Initiative in the Americas, implemented with the support of the United States Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration) consolidates and harmonizes secondary data including administrative data (border entries and exits) already collected by governments into a regional database. The database enables the month-by-month analysis of mobility patterns disaggregated by nationality in the Americas. Data is sourced from publicly accessible government platforms and, in some cases, direct sharing between IOM and national authorities. </p>

        <p>This interactive report presents the consolidated data through a dynamic map visualization, allowing users to explore cross-border movement patterns across countries, indicators, and time. The map displays, for each selected country and year, the composition and magnitude of recorded entries, exits, or irregular entries (the countries that report data on irregular entries are Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Honduras) by nationality. Complementing this, the report includes a focused analytical section highlighting key trends in Venezuelan mobility, offering contextual insights to support data interpretation.</p>
